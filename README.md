# Joomla! NuLiga Component

This is a Joomla! component to manage NuLiga teams and tables.
The component supports Joomla! 3.0 and higher.

While the component only allows to manage NuLiga entities at the moment, you can use the [NuLiga plugin](https://github.com/sebschlicht/plg_nuliga) to display NuLiga tables in articles, for example.

## Compatibility

This component supports PHP 5.6+ (including PHP 7).

## Installation

Simply download the latest [release](https://github.com/sebschlicht/com_nuliga/releases) and install the package via the extension manager.
The extension supports the update manager, thus you will be notified about updates by your Joomla! instance automatically.

## Usage

Go to `Components > NuLiga` and add the teams that you would like to display tables for.
The team fields should be pretty self-explanatory.

Then use the [plugin](https://github.com/sebschlicht/plg_nuliga) to display a NuLiga table of a team in an article, for example.
